# sarlopt: Single-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Global Optimization
**sarlopt** uses single-agent Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) to learn optimization algorithms automatically. We intend to convert the repo to a library in the future. Currently, the codes are implemented in Python with [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) and [TF-Agents](https://github.com/tensorflow/agents).
